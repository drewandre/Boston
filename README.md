# HyperSpace LED Drum Kit
###### Featured on band Boston's 2017 HyperSpace Tour: 14-channel LED controller for use with piezo sensors, WS2812b LEDS, Teensy 3.2
*This project uses hardware which cannot be made publically available due to the nature of client contract. The firmware, though, uses the <a href='https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED'>FastLED</a> library running on a <a href='https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html'>Teensy 3.2</a>. Regular ol' pizeo sensors can be used to send trigger events to the Teensy, which should through full bridge rectifiers to covert the AC signals to a safe, readable DC range for the Microcontroller.*

## Description
- Version 1.3 - Boston, MA - June 2017
- The HyperSpace LED Drum Kit system reads piezo drum sensor events and triggers various LED effects. The system is waterproof, extensively stress-tested for road conditions, and configurable on-the-fly. The system can save noise thresholds for any number of drummers/playing styles, and features a high-contrast OLED screen for configuration.
- The effects uploaded here are highly specific to client specifications, but can be configured to taste.

*Music legends BOSTON continue their Hyper Space Tour this summer with the iconic JOAN JETT & THE BLACKHEARTS, for an additional 21 cities, presented by Live Nation. Performances with Joan Jett will begin on Wednesday, June 14 in Mountain View, CA at Shoreline Amphitheatre, and continue eastward across North America. More information can be found at livenation.com. Itinerary for the Live Nation portion of BOSTONâ€™s Hyper Space Tour with Joan Jett below.*
          
  
  This is a revised version of the project with the LEDS now running in parallel
  for a framerate increase of ~125% (15fps to ~64fps). This leaves more time
  to read the drum triggers, thus giving a more reactive feel to the kit.
  
## Hardware
  This systems assumes the following pin/cable mapping:
  ```
  * CHAN 1: tom one       CHAN 8:  cymbal one
  * CHAN 2: tom two       CHAN 9:  cymbal two
  * CHAN 3: tom three     CHAN 10: cymbal three
  * CHAN 4: tom four      CHAN 11: cymbal four
  * CHAN 5: kick_left     CHAN 12: cymbal five
  * CHAN 6: kick_right    CHAN 13: aux one
  * CHAN 7: snare         CHAN 14: aux two
  ```

  This program does not write to each drum in that order, however.
  Teensy 3.2 + FastLED 16-channel parallel output will write
  in the following order:

```
  - CH:     DRUM:
  - ch. 1   (tom one)       TRUE  0   21
  - ch. 11  (cymbal 4)      TRUE  1   190
  - ch. 4   (tom four)      TRUE  2   84
  - ch. 5   (kick left)     TRUE  3   0
  - ch. 3   (tom 3)         TRUE  4   63
  - ch. 9   (cymbal 2)      TRUE  5   147
  - ch. 8   (cymbal 1)      TRUE  6   126
  - ch. 2   (tom two)       TRUE  7   42
  - ch. 10  (cymbal three)  TRUE  8   169
  so here we are missing 9 and 10, respectively strips 15 and 16
  account for by placing dummy triggers at strip #9 and #10
  - ch. 6   (kick right)    true  11  0
  - ch. 7   (snare)         true  12  105
  - ch. 12  (cymbal 5)      true  13  211
  - ch. 14  (aux 2)         true  14  253
  - ch. 13  (aux 1)         true  15  232
```

  Voltage dividers for piezo sensors use a 10pf cap and varying resistor values to remove vibration noise
```
  Suggested resistor values for setting piezo noise floor:
  - TOM 1:
  - TOM 2: 6.2M Ohms 5%
  - TOM 3: 10M Ohms 5%
  - TOM 4: 13M Ohms 5% 
  - KICK L: 13M Ohms 5%
  - KICK R: 13M Ohms 5%
  - SNARE: 13M Ohm 5%
  ```
